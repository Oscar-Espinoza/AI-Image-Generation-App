## ‚≠êÔ∏è Show your support <a name="support"></a>

I am thrilled to announce my new app called DALL-E. This app allows you to generate AI-generated images from writing a prompt using the OpenAI API, and share these images with the community. The tech stack I used to build this app includes React, Vite, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

I put a lot of dedication and hard work into developing this app, and I'm confident it will meet all your image generation needs. Whether you're an artist, writer, or just someone who loves to experiment with AI, I believe this app will provide you with a seamless experience.

I would appreciate your support by downloading and using my app. Your feedback will help me continue to improve and add new features to the app.

Thank you for your consideration. I can't wait for you to experience the amazing power of AI with my DALL-E app.

Best regards,

Oscar.

## üôè Acknowledgments <a name="acknowledgements"></a>

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for providing the API that powers this DALL-E clone. Without the incredible work of OpenAI and its team, this app would not have been possible.

I am in awe of the amazing advancements in the field of artificial intelligence that OpenAI has contributed to, and I feel privileged to be able to leverage some of these innovations in my own work.

Thank you, OpenAI, for making the world a better and more exciting place through the power of AI.
